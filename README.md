# C-AnalysisProject

Find the attached **Coursework.pdf**. This repo contains a set of programs used for solving a set of Initial Value and Boundary Value problem Differential Equations. It makes use of a range of numerical analysis methods, and uses the produced data to comppare the accuracy of each method. The methods used are as follows:
- Forward Euler
- Backward Euler
- Stormer Verlet

These methods are first applied in 1 Dimension. Then making use of a custom **Vector** library, the methods are also applied in 2-dimensions.
